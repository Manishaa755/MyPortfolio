                <h2>Learn Python in fun way!!!</h2>
                <p>What is Python? Executive Summary
                    Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.
                    Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, 
                    make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a 
                    scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, 
                    easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program 
                    maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and 
                    code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or 
                    binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.
                    
                    <h4>Often, programmers fall in love with Python</h4> because of the increased productivity it provides.
                     Since there is no compilation step,
                     the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input
                      will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises
                       an exception. When the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace.
                        A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary 
                        expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. 
                        The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python's introspective power. On the other hand, 
                        often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a
                     few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach
                      very effective.</p>

                <h2>Learn Java in fun way!!!</h2>
                <p>What is Java programming language used for? 
                    Because Java is a free-to-use and a versatile language, it builds localized and distributed software. Some common uses of Java include:
                    
                    <h5>1. Game Development</h5>
                    Many popular mobile, computer, and video games are built in Java. Even modern games that integrate advanced technology like machine learning or virtual reality are built with Java technology.
                    
                    <h5>2.     Cloud computing</h5>
                    Java is often referred to as WORA â€“ Write Once and Run Anywhere, making it perfect for decentralized cloud-based applications. Cloud providers choose Java language to run programs on a wide range of underlying platforms.
                    
                    <h5>3.     Big Data</h5>
                    Java is used for data processing engines that can work with complex data sets and massive amounts of real-time data.
                    
                    <h5>4.     Artificial Intelligence</h5>
                    Java is a powerhouse of machine learning libraries. Its stability and speed make it perfect for artificial intelligence application development like natural language processing and deep learning.</p>
